Store in the database a version number of the seed data and keep a similar number hardwired in the build-db script. If the build-db script has a higher version number, it must destroy the database and rebuild it, otherwise the database is good as it is. This way, i can run the build-db script in the build process, and run it on every push to heroku/master (hopefully building the database won't take more than 5 minutes).
