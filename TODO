## Database seeding

To make database seeding faster and easier, make an intermediate json file with all daijirin articles grouped by lemma and glosses, and commit it, so that heroku will build from there.

Store in the database a version number of the seed data and keep a similar number hardwired in the build-db script. If the build-db script has a higher version number, it must destroy the database and rebuild it, otherwise the database is good as it is. This way, i can run the build-db script in the build process, and run it on every push to heroku/master (hopefully building the database won't take more than 5 minutes).

## Heroku stuff
See if one-off dynos can be a good idea for the database seeding
